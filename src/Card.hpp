/*
 * Class that represents one of the 52 cards of a Texas Hold'em card game.
 * The Card class is characterized by 2 attributes: mrank and mcolor.
 *
 * mrank is a number comprised between 1 and 13 included and stores the rank of the
 * card according to the following conversion table: (mrank -> card rank)
 * 		1 -> 2 / 2 -> 3 / 3 -> 4 / 4 -> 5 / 5 -> 6 / 6 -> 7 / 7 -> 8 / 8 -> 9 / 9 -> 10 /
 * 		10 -> J / 11 -> Q / 12 -> K / 13 -> A
 *
 * msuit is a number comprised between 1 and 4 included and stores the suit of the card
 * according to the following conversion table: (msuit -> card suit)
 * 		1 -> Club (TrÃ¨fle) / 2 -> Diamond (Carreau) / 3 -> Heart (Coeur) /
 * 		4 -> Spade (Pique)
 *
 * For the sake of clarity, Cards objects are related through the following notation
 * convention in the rest of the documentation: (mrank, msuit).
 *
 * Note that an undefined card is refered as (0,0).
